# Portfolio (ready-to-run)

Quick start ✅

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).
- For a local server (recommended), run:
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 5500` then open `http://localhost:5500`
  - Or use VS Code Live Server extension and serve the folder.

Customize 🔧
- Replace `Your Name`, email, LinkedIn and project text in `index.html`.
- Replace `assets/*.svg` with your screenshots (keep filenames or update `index.html`).
- Edit colors & spacing in `styles.css` and interactions in `script.js`.

Deploy 🚀
- Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages, or deploy to any static host (Netlify, Vercel).

Accessibility & tips 💡
- Add real alt text to images and provide links to live demos & repos in the projects.
- Replace the mailto fallback with a serverless form endpoint when ready.

If you want, I can:
1) Populate this site with your real name, bio, and 3 project descriptions (requires details).
2) Add a contact form backed by Netlify/Forms or a small server endpoint.
